# Set the bpm as you wish

##### Seventh activity #####
#  Use the structure of live_loops to create your song
#  you can use samples or play notes, just take
#  care of the amount of sleeps in each live_loop.
#  It would be nice to have the same amount or,
#  at least, a value that is multiple of 4 (beats).
#
#  The main challenge is to continue modifying your song
#  without press "stop" and "run" again, just press
#  "run" after your changes to check how it is!
#
#  Tip: Try one live_loop at each time!
#  Tip: upload to https://forms.gle/ThAM3PWDg3oQZmuJ9 when done!
